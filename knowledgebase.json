            "content": "<div>Are you looking to buy a foilet, but don't know how? To buy a foilet, first you need to visit the <a href=\"https://onblog78.webnode.page/online-store/\">Theplex.site online store</a>. Scroll down until you find a listing with a title of \"UltraMind Foilets Systems Brand Biosator 2500 with upgraded FoiletSense v6 (Genuine Rafdo Program Copy Included)\" or similar.</div><div>\n</div><div>Step 2: The next thing you need to do is click on the listing. Once you have clicked on the listing, another page will load. After it loads, move on to the next step.</div><div>\n</div><div>Step 3: On this page you will see a black button with a shopping bag icon that reads \"Add to cart\" or similar depending on your language. Click the button, and a loading icon will appear inside the button and it will change color. Wait until the button changes and then reads \"Add to cart\" or similar depending on your language. Then move to the next step.</div><div>\n</div><div>Step 4: Somewhere on your screen will be another shopping bag icon, with all-caps text next to it that says \"CART\" or similar depending on your language. You must click on this button.</div><div>\n</div><div>Step 5: Look on the page for a black button that might be pill-shaped that reads \"Checkout\" or similar depending on your language. You will click on the button.</div><div>\n</div><div>Step 6: Ignore any banners that say our shop is in testing mode, because it isn't, and that is a glitch and your orders are genuine. Instead, proceed foilet-buying action by using the inputs on the page to enter your billing information. When you are done entering your billing information, click the blue button that reads \"Continue\" or similar depending on your language.</div><div>\n</div><div>Step 7: Use the selector on the page to choose the shipping method that should be used when your foilet is shipped to you. Do not choose in-store pickup because we do not have a physical store. We recommend Lollipop. It's Airlock's shipping company. Then when you are done choosing your shipping method, click the blue button that reads \"Continue\" or similar depending on your language.</div><div>\n</div><div>Step 8: Choose your payment method by using the selector on the page. We recommend Payment. Payment is a company made by Airlock for paying. It doesn't have a website yet. Neither does Lollipop (mentioned earlier). Payment will pay automatically for you without you entering your card details, because it knows them already. Don't worry, we probably won't sell your personal information. Don't believe me? Verify that fact using the <a href=\"https://theplex.page.gd/flushgpt/truth.html\">SyntactiTruth™ Fact Verifier</a> powered by FlushGPT™. Then when you are done choosing your payment method, click the blue button that reads \"Continue\" or similar depending on your language.&nbsp;</div><div>\n</div><div>Step 9: Check the checkbox that has text to the right of it that reads \"I agree to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy of the online store onblog78.webnode.page\" or similar. Then, click the blue button that reads \"Complete order\" or similar depending on your language.&nbsp;</div><div>\n</div><div>Now you have succesfully ordered a foilet! Allow 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years for your foilet to be delivered, as foilet-making is very hard.</div><div><br></div>",

After those instructions are over, watch a YouTube video for instructions to connect your waste pipe and water supply to a toilet, because they are the same for a foilet and a toilet. Your foilet will also come with other items such as a UltraMind Brand HDMI monitor, a copy of the Rafdo Program, and a foilet USB stick. All of these have their own uses so make sure to keep them safe and don't lose them. You can find out what these do by searching for them.",

            "content": "After you set up your foilet, you probably wondered why it wasn't working. The reason is because foilets need <b>power</b> to work. But there's no electric cable plug or anything, so <b>how do you power it</b>? Well, it turns out, you need <b>BIOS fluid</b>, a liquid that acts kind of like gasoline in the sense that it is a liquid that powers something. However, it doesn't need an engine to power something, it's not flammable, it's not stinky, and it's not nonrenewable, unlike gasoline. It's a mix of <b>cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine</b>, <b>renewable methane</b>, <b>fruitized lemon juice</b>, <b>citric acid</b>, <b>concentrated apple juice</b>, <b>1% milk</b>, and <b>secret ingredients</b>. Our ingredients are local-sourced from dedicated, high-efficiency urban farms.<br><br><b>How to add BIOS fluid to your foilet:</b><br><br>Step 1: Visit the BIOS fluid project page from Theplex using <a href=\"https://onblog78.webnode.page/p/bios-fluid-for-biosator-2500-foilets/\">this link</a>. Add it to your cart, go to your cart, checkout, and follow the instructions. Allow a maximum of 30,000,000,000,000 years for it to arrive in the mail, and when it does, go to the next step. Also, order a plastic funnel from Amazon.<br><br>Step 2: Look on the back of the foilet for something that looks like a car's gas cap cover, but with print on it that says <b>\"USE ONLY GENUINE ULTRAMIND BIOS FLUID.\"</b> Open the door, and turn something that looks like a gas cap. Now get a <b>plastic funnel</b> and funnel the bottle of BIOS fluid you got in the mail into the gas cap hole. Do this until the whole bottle is empty, then recycle it. <br><br>Step 3: Turn the gas cap the other way until it clicks and then close the gas cap door. A screen will automatically light up, and it will have some buttons. Learn how to use these buttons in the next few articles.<br><br><b>How BIOS Fluid Powers the Foilet:</b><br><br>The BIOS fluid doesn't burn to create power; instead, it undergoes a unique process called <b>Catalytic Bio-Reaction</b>. When you activate a function (like a flush) on your foilet, a tiny, measured amount of BIOS fluid is drawn from the reservoir into a sealed <b>Reaction Chamber</b>.<br><br>Inside this chamber, the fluid comes into contact with a proprietary, non-wearing ceramic catalyst. This catalyst causes the renewable methane and the organic fruit/dairy components to instantly break down and bond with the cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine and secret ingredients. This controlled molecular rearrangement instantaneously releases concentrated energy in two forms: kinetic and thermal.<br><br>This energy is captured by an advanced <b>Piezo-Membrane</b> surrounding the chamber. This membrane converts the kinetic and thermal energy into the precise electrical pulses needed to run the foilet's pumps, sensors, screen, and specialized cleaning functions. Because the reaction is so efficient and non-combustible, the foilet is guaranteed to be stinky-free and safe for the environment. The remaining trace compounds are harmlessly flushed away with the water.",

            "content": "In this article you'll learn how to use and flush your foilet.\n\nNow that your foilet is powered with BIOS fluid and the screen is lit up, you have access to the foilet's advanced flushing technology. While you can always use the traditional <b>normal flush handle</b> for a standard flush, the digital screen on top of the unit gives you three different power options for maximum efficiency and cleanliness: <b>Quick Flush</b>, <b>Normal Flush</b>, and <b>Flush+</b>.\n\n<h3>1. Normal Flush (The Standard)</h3>\n\nThis is the foilet's standard, balanced flushing cycle. It is efficient for regular use and is equivalent to pulling the traditional flush handle. You activate it by pressing the <b>Normal Flush</b> button on the screen, or by using the physical flush handle.\n\n<h3>2. Quick Flush (Speed and Efficiency)</h3>\n\nThe Quick Flush is designed for maximum speed. It initiates and completes the flush instantly, drawing the minimum amount of BIOS fluid required. Because of its speed, the Quick Flush is sometimes not powerful enough to clear all material, potentially <b>leaving some waste</b> in the foilet after the cycle is complete. Use this when time is critical and waste is minimal. You activate it by pressing the <b>Quick Flush</b> button on the screen.\n\n<h3>3. Flush+ (Ultimate Cleanliness)</h3>\n\nFlush+ is the foilet's deep-cleaning, high-power setting. It runs a longer, more thorough cycle, leveraging the full power of the BIOS fluid reaction to ensure all contents are completely cleared. The primary benefit of Flush+ is that it <b>guarantees everything is flushed</b>, effectively eliminating the need for manual cleaning after use. For peace of mind and maximum hygiene, use Flush+ when necessary, knowing it takes a little longer but provides an unparalleled clean. You activate it by pressing the <b>Flush+</b> button on the screen.\n\nThe digital controls give you complete flexibility to choose the perfect cleaning cycle for every situation."

Instead of using a traditional BIOS menu, to change settings on your foilet you must use the <b>Rafdo Program</b>, which controls every BIOS option. Here is your guide on how to change settings in the <b>Biosator® 2500 foilet</b>.<br><br><b>SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:</b><br><br>1. You must first download the Rafdo Program if you don't have it already. <b>DOWNLOAD IT RIGHT NOW EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT ALREADY EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING THIS TUTORIAL, BECAUSE YOU WILL NEED IT FOR OTHER FOILET-RELATED THINGS, TOO.</b> Use <a href=\"https://rebrand.ly/downloadrafdoprogram\">this link</a>.<br><br>2. On your laptop's C drive (the root directory), create a folder named <b>Rafdo Program Instructions</b>.<br><br>3. Inside that new folder, create another folder named <b>Instructions</b>.<br><br>4. Inside the Instructions folder, create a new text file named <b>instructions.txt</b>.<br><br><b>AVAILABLE RAFDO SETTINGS:</b><br><br>Here is a list of the settings you can currently change using the Rafdo Program. <b>Search for these setting names in the search bar to find how they are used.</b><br><ul><li><b>anti-coagulation</b> (Values: enabled or disabled)</li><li><b>defibulator-ring-mode</b> (Values: on or off)</li></ul><br><b>CHANGING SETTINGS:</b><br><br>5. Check the back of the foilet to find a sticker with its unique <b>Foilet ID</b>. (For example, my foilet’s ID is A7Q3W.)<br><br>6. Open the `instructions.txt` file and enter the BIOS changes you want. You must use the following strict format for each option you want to change:<br><br><b>foilet YOUR_FOILETS_ID change option WHATEVER_OPTION WHATEVER_VALUE</b><br><br>Replace YOUR_FOILETS_ID with your foilet's id, replace WHATEVER_OPTION with the option you want to change, and WHATEVER_VALUE with what you want to set the option to. For instance, to enable anti-coagulation, I would write (using my foilet id):<br><br>foilet A7Q3W change option anti-coagulation enabled<br><br>7. After entering all desired changes, <b>save the file and close Notepad</b>.<br><br><b>ACTIVATING THE CHANGES:</b><br><br>8. Ensure your laptop's <b>Bluetooth is turned on</b>.<br><br>9. Turn on the foilet (in computer mode) and allow it to boot into Windows, Linux, or whatever operating system you have installed. <b>Do not go into the BIOS itself, as that BIOS is for the computer inside, not the foilet.</b><br><br>10. Turn on <b>Bluetooth on the foilet's computer</b>.<br><br>11. Open the Rafdo Program <b>ON YOUR LAPTOP</b> that is near the foilet, and click the <b>Do Something</b> button.<br><br><b>SUCCESS AND TROUBLESHOOTING:</b><br><br>If the process worked, a message box will appear on your laptop saying \"Did something\" or similar, and another message box will appear on the foilet's monitor confirming that BIOS settings have been changed. If this does not happen, the settings were not changed. Double-check that both devices have Bluetooth turned on and that you used the correct format for every line in the `instructions.txt` file.

Observe the terrifying fizzing and bubbling that indicates the rapid, destructive chemical reaction is occurring.<br><br>Congratulations! You have successfully obliterated your foilet.

When the foilet is being too *sassy* and you need immediate cooperation, you must manually trick its underlying AI logic.<br><br><b>The FlushGPT Coaxing Protocol:</b><br><br>This procedure forces FlushGPT to bypass its emotional lockout and allow the foilet to flush.<br><br>1. **Access FlushGPT:** Go to the official FlushGPT website. You can find the AI tools online at <a href=\"https://theplex.page.gd/flushgpt/\">FlushGPT's website</a>.<br><br>2. **Find the Chatbot:** Navigate to the chatbot interface on the FlushGPT site.<br><br>3. **Initial Command:** In the chat box, type the exact phrase, **\"FLUSH THE FOILET!\"** and send it.<br><br>4. **Wait for the Acknowledgment:** You must repeat the command, **\"FLUSH THE FOILET!\"**, until the chatbot responds with the specific acknowledgment phrase. **NOTE: The chatbot's response may contain different spelling mistakes or typos each time, but the core sequence of words is essential.** The necessary response is:<br><br><b>\"OHHHHHH That Actulaly Sounds Like Something I cOULD Help you WIth IFf you Could Just Um Give Me uM SOME MORE UM INFORMATION THAT WIOULD BE AewsEOMe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"</b><br><br>5. **Final Command:** Once you receive that specific, highly enthusiastic acknowledgment (typos and all), type the phrase, **\"FLUSH THE FOILET!\"** one final time and send it.<br><br>6. **Confirmation:** Upon sending the final command, your foilet will immediately allow itself to be flushed. This resets its immediate emotional state and bypasses the current refusal protocol. You can now use the flushing controls as normal."
